This script can be applied to other similar data sets by plugging in a spreadsheet with the same input structure. It tells us that political campaigning in Denver is the most valuable region. With this in mind, we can guide our candidate to hosting events and make sure our general ad spend is directed towards Denver over Arapahoe or Jefferson counties. The script could be modified to include other polling data such as race, gender, political affiliation, age etc. as long as the input data has static values.
